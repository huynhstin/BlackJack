To Do:

  Ace logic:
    
    -> Switch from 1 to 11 as needed
    
  Dealer
  
    -> One of the dealer's cards is visible
    
  Dealing cards:
  
    -> Player gets two cards at the start
    
  View hands:
  
    -> Dealer has one visible card.
    
  Stand logic:
  
    -> When finished, move on to dealer
    
  Split deck:
  
    -> When hand has two of the same cards, split into two hands
    
    -> Only when initially dealt
    
    -> Each hand gets dealt one more card, then proceed as normal
      
      -> Can pick which of the two split hands to hit with
    
  Other logic:
  
    -> Dealer must hit if less than 16, stand if at least 17
    
    -> You can't hit after you split
